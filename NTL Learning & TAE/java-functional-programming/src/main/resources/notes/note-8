//Stream (single use declarative sequential data pipelines with lazy execution)
Stream are different way of dealing with collection
or another design pattern of processing the element in collection

Why Stream API
* Alternative approach to "process" a collection
* declarative approach (instruct a program on what needs to done, instead of telling it how to do it)
* lazy evaluation
* utilize functional programming
