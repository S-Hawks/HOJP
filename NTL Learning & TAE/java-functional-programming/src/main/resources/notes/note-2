1.This is a first class function...
myFunction = public void doTask() {
    System.out.println("Hello world")
}

2. No need to use excess modifier
myFunction = void doTask(){
    System.out.println("Hello World");
}

3. No need to use method name -> though there is a variable to refer the function so method name is don't make any seance
myFunction = void (){
    System.out.println("Hello World);
}

4. The return type is infrared, infrared by what's on the right hand side/ no need to use return type return type specify by left hand side

myFunction = () {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
}

5. Finally one minor modification a arrow that's makes it as a LAMBDA expression
myFunction = () -> {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
}
