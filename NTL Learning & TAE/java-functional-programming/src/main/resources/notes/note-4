Difference between Anonymous Class and Lambda
Anonymous class mainly trigger Object creation basically when we use "new"
it's call the constructor (basic way to create a class in java)

Lambda trigger "invokedynamic" instruction
**invokedynamic
    -Called "indy"
    -JVM opcode
    -introduce in java 7
    -meant to support dynamically typed language

invokedynamic and lambdas
    -Classes not created at compile time
    -the bytecode manages this at runtime
    -doesn't generate the class until the first invocation
